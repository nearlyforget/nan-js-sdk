  <h1 align="center">UCP JavaScript SDK</h1>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Official JavaScript library for the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP).</b>
</p>

## Overview

This repository contains the JavaScript SDK for the
[Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)](https://ucp.dev). It provides TypeScript
types and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schemas for UCP models, making it easy to
build UCP-compliant applications in JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Installation

To install the SDK in your project, run:

```bash
npm install @ucp-js/sdk
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

This project uses `npm` for package management and `typescript` for building.

### Generating Models

The models are automatically generated from the JSON schemas in the [UCP
Specification](https://ucp.dev).

To regenerate the models, you first need a local copy of the [UCP specification](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp). If you don't have one, you can clone it via:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp.git
```

Then, run `npm run generate` pointing to the `spec` folder of the cloned
repository, e.g.:

```bash
npm run generate -- ucp/spec
```

### Building

To build the project for both CommonJS and ESM:

```bash
npm run build
```

We welcome community contributions. See our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
